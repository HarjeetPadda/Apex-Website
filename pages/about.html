        <h3>Our Promise.</h3>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.2rem;">We don’t believe best in class is enough - you need best in all classes. That’s what we deliver. Individually tailored, need’s specific logistics solutions. From time and temperature sensitive to delivery on demand - and anything else your business needs to deliver too.</p>
            <h3>The traditional way.</h3>   
            <p>Manufacturers and exporters view their supply chain as a cost of doing business, not a way of doing good business. And they choose their logistics providers on cost and capability - but only look within their standard scope. </p>
            <p>Strategies such as these, whilst effective, usually create locked-in thinking and often become inefficient and ineffective.</p>
            <p>Because without change, there can be no positive change. </p>
            <h3>The Apex Way.</h3>
            <p>We don’t view your supply chain in this traditional way – we see it as a valuable corporate asset.</p>
            <p>And assets should deliver profitability, just as a new product or new customer would.</p>
            <p>To achieve this - we focus on delivering three (3) key clear principles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Reduce the cost to serve </span>(by enabling volume economics and utilisation benefit)</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Streamline product flow to market </span>(Eliminate business inhibitors and flow risks)</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">3. Enable control tower performance monitoring and execution </span>(Leading-edge control IT System).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We apply logistics experience to jointly identify opportunities, model the benefits and collaboratively implement in priority order, in combination of best company capability and best in all classes partnerships with domestic and international providers. </p>
            <p>Once implemented we are accountable to ensure cost and service target(s) are delivered, to do so we utilise leading edge information technology to monitor, control and manage a high performing & optimised logistics capability.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="about-section4">
        <h3>The Apex Difference.</h3>
        <p>We not only provide visibility and exception management within your supply chain, but also perform real time ‘what if?’ scenario analysis to model potential solutions to a problem, or take advantage of new opportunities, by considering all partners within the supply chain. And our broader network.</p> 
        <p>We do this through both our predictive analysis tools, and importantly, through our direct collaboration with our multiple partners, delivering a constantly optimised outcome.</p>
        <p>We never stop delivering.</p>
