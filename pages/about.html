            <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.2rem;">We don’t believe in one solution for all thats why we deliver individually tailored supply chain solutions. From time sensitive deliveries to specialised freight delivered right to your door.</p>
            <h3>The traditional way.</h3>   
            <p>Manufacturers and exporters view their supply chain as a cost of doing business, not a way of doing good business. And they choose their logistics providers on cost and capability - but only look within their standard scope. </p>
            <p>Strategies such as these, whilst effective, usually create locked-in thinking and often become inefficient and ineffective.</p>
            <p>Because without change, there can be no positive change. </p>
            <h3>The Apex Way.</h3>
            <p>We don’t view your supply chain in this traditional way – we see it as a valuable corporate asset.</p>
            <p>And assets should deliver profitability, just as a new product or new customer would.</p>
            <p>To achieve this - we focus on delivering three (3) key clear principles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Reduce the cost to serve </span>(by enabling volume economics and utilisation benefit)</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Streamline product flow to market </span>(Eliminate business inhibitors and flow risks)</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">3. Enable control tower performance monitoring and execution </span>(Leading-edge control IT System).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We apply logistics experience to jointly identify opportunities, model the benefits and collaboratively implement in priority order, in combination of best company capability and best in all classes partnerships with domestic and international providers. </p>
            <p>Once implemented we are accountable to ensure cost and service target(s) are delivered, to do so we utilise leading edge information technology to monitor, control and manage a high performing & optimised logistics capability.</p>

        <h3>The Apex Difference.</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Quality customer service</span> has been the foundation of our business for years. Our team is dedicated to
            providing excellent customer service and doing relationship with our customers the right way. Ensuring
            we understand our customers’ needs and by doing our very best to provide the best possible solutions
            to any problem.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Honesty and Accountability</span> are our two watchwords we abide by in our business. We realize that often
            a customer’s experience with business is usually one where they are kept in the dark about certain
            information and can feel like they are not being told the complete story, where they are treated like a
            transaction. We ensure we always remain honest to our customers and ourselves when we carry out any
            task and ensure we take on complete accountability of your business with us.</p>
